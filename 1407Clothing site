This site I have just recently created was meant to be committed to my git account. Its nothing much but feel free to try it and rate it.
I have used only three technologies in my site, HTML, CSS, & JS.
The host of the site in my perspective is supposed to be adding items to be sold dynamically using the JS code. There are srtuctures in JS code that will be creating the items on the site.
